# HR_Attrition-Dashboard
A comprehensive dashboard analyzing employee attrition trends and metrics. This project helps visualize the factors influencing staff turnover, such as job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and much more.
Built for data-driven decision-making in HR management.

## Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations as it leads to the loss of skilled labor, increased recruitment costs, and potential drops in productivity.
This project aims to identify the key factors driving employee attrition and help Human Resources make informed, data-backed decisions to improve retention.

## Data Source
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.com, a platform for open and real time datasets.

## Methods and Tools
Data Cleaning: Performed using Microsoft Excel to remove errors and prepare the dataset.

Data Exploration: SQL queries were written and executed using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to better understand data distributions and relationships.

Visualization: Built a dynamic and interactive dashboard using Power BI to reveal attrition trends and patterns across different categories.

## Insights and Findings
Employees with low job satisfaction and work-life balance had higher attrition rates.

Younger employees (ages 26â€“35) were more likely to leave the company.

Employees in the Sales and Human Resources departments showed higher turnover.

Overtime and longer working hours were positively correlated with attrition.
